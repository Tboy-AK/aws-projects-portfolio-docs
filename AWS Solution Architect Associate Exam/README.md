# AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam

## Introduction

The AWS Solution Architect Associate (SAA) exam was that hurdle I needed to cross to give me the confidence of being a cloud professional. And yes, it indeed was the confidence booster for me.
However, this was not because of the exam itself, but my studies.
Gaining all the knowledge I did while preparing for the exam was an eye opener.
It was an eye opener for me to possibilities with the cloud and requirements that should be met.
The requirments spoken about are mostly best practices especially in the line of security and governance.

One of my most interesting quotes, which my pastor emphasises, is that security is the guardrail that gives us freedom - true freedom.
That is the kind of freedom we all desire. The kind of freedom that when we have, we can go to bed knowing that everything is fine with a very clear conscience.

Security and governance give an organisation a good edge towards industrial and regulatory compliance.

## Prerequisite

- 3 months of intense study: That is, at least 3 months to your exam date.
- 1 year of experience working with diverse services in AWS: You don't have to work with all services, but basic services in the range of networking, compute, data stores, observability, and security.

## Preparation Path

- [AWS Power Hour](https://awspowerhour.com/): This is a series of episodes focused on succeeding in the exam. It is usually a yearly online program on Twitch or LinkedIn. Promos such as AWS exam discount vouchers are sometimes shared, you shouldn't miss them.
- AWS Solutions Architect Associate Exam Guide: This guide contains content that directs you on what to look out for and what to ignore for the exam. Note that this gets updated over time, so you should usually check for the latest version.
- [AWS Well-Architected Framwework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected): This is what all AWS architects need. It is a deep dive into architecting on AWS. It contains 6 pillars
- [AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws): A pool of AWS content developed and curated AWS and its trainers. From videos to articales to labs to games to practice exams, you get a tonne of resources that will help you prepare for any of the AWS exams. However, you need to know what to look for.
- SAA practice exams: This will particularly give you an idea of what to expect in the SAA examination. There are two types of practice exams including, the official pracitce exam questions and a minitature verrsion of that which is free. The minitature version is good enough if you have a full grasp of the well-architected framework. You can take the practice exams twice, that is, long before your exam date and close to your exam date.
- Notes and idea maps: It is important to take notes on things you learn (neuro-elasticity), and create maps between things you learn (neuroplasticity). Add images to your notes also: an image speaks a thousand words at a single glance. AWS is really good at creating images that give a good understanding of concepts.
- CloudQuest: A gamified AWS full-fledged learning material with a lot of real-world examples on AWS Skill Builder.
- Cloud Practitioner exam: Take it before sitting for the SAA exam. Although this is not a perequisite, it will give you an idea of what to expect for an AWS examination. Thereby giving you the confidence you need to succeed in the SAA exam.
